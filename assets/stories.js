  "Like every {{time of day:morning}}, Calina gets to the {{place:office}} early." +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "Nobody else is in the Harvest office yet and so she decides to have {{beverage:tea}} " +
  "before starting her first shift—without {{ingredient:sugar}}, of course, as that doesn’t " +
  "go well with a sugar-free diet." +
  "<br />" +
  "The kettle boils, and the first round of tickets awaits." +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "While walking back to her {{location:desk}} through the empty office she thinks about " +
  "that latest short story by George Saunders. “What a great {{occupation:writer}}”, she says " +
  "to herself. Calina is {{adjective (mood):delighted}} as usual and looking forward to another {{adjective:fun}} " +
  "and {{adjective:exciting}} day at Harvest, {{verb (-ing):helping out}} customers and becoming better at " +
  "understanding Futurist poems at the same time. “This is something racing " +
  "Japanese muscle cars could never have taught me”, " +
  "she realizes, when suddenly the front door opens with a loud {{sound:noise}}." +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "Quickly she looks back over her shoulder: It’s Christopher walking in with " +
  "Pickles, his girlfriend’s {{animal:dog}}. Being the {{adjective:loving}} person Calina is she greets " +
  "Pickles {{adverb:heartwarmingly}}. After a while of playing with it she reaches for her " +
  "phone in order to share their {{adjective:cute}} picture with the world." +
  "<br />" +
  "Suddenly, a loud scream breaks the idyllic scene: “Oh no!”, she shrieks. " +
  "“It’s gone! I have lost my phone!”. Christopher laughs." +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "A few minutes pass and Calina becomes conscious again, woken up by the " +
  "distinct sound of Shawn complaning about a {{noun:cookie}} in another corner of the " +
  "{{place:office}}. “What happened?”, she asks Christopher, who is jamming out to his " +
  "favorite tunes at his {{location:desk}} across from her. “What happened?”. Also her " +
  "second question goes unanswered when a familar thought comes to mind: " +
  "“Sometimes I wish I would be working from {{location:within a whale’s heart}}. No drama, " +
  "just being at piece.”, she thinks. " +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "Finally going back to answering all the {{adjective:important}} questions about {{activity:time " +
  "tracking}} and {{another activity:invoicing}} she stumbles across a strangely looking link. " +
  "It takes her to a {{appearance:beautiful}} website that, after prompting her to input " +
  "{{count:several}} words, presents her with a precise write-up of her morning. " +
  "Reading it with great {{noun (mood):pleasure}} all the way to the end makes her understand " +
  "the reasons for all of the weird events of her morning: It’s her {{occasion:birthday}}!" +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "Happy Birthday, Calina!";
