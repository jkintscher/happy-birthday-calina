  "Like every morning, Calina gets to work early." +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "Nobody else is in the Harvest office yet and so she decides to make tea " +
  "before starting her first shift—without sugar, of course, as that doesn’t " +
  "go well with a sugar-free diet." +
  "<br />" +
  "The kettle boils, and the first round of tickets awaits." +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "While walking back to her desk through the empty office she thinks about " +
  "that latest short story by George Saunders. “What a great writer”, she says " +
  "to herself. Calina is delighted as usual and looking forward to another fun " +
  "and exciting day at Harvest, helping out customers and becoming better at " +
  "understanding Futurist poems at the same time. “This is something racing " +
  "Japanese muscle cars could never have taught me”, " +
  "she realizes, when suddenly the front door opens with a loud noise." +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "Quickly she looks back over her shoulder: It’s Christopher walking in with " +
  "Pickles, his girlfriend’s dog. Being the loving person Calina is she greets " +
  "Pickles heartwarmingly. After a while of playing with it she reaches for her " +
  "phone in order to share their cute picture with the world." +
  "<br />" +
  "Suddenly, a loud scream breaks the idyllic scene: “Oh no!”, she shrieks. " +
  "“It’s gone! I have lost my phone!”. Christopher laughs." +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "A few minutes pass and Calina becomes conscious again, woken up by the " +
  "distinct sound of Shawn complaning about a cookie in another corner of the " +
  "office. “What happened?”, she asks Christopher, who is jamming out to his " +
  "favorite tunes at his desk across from her. “What happened?”. Also her " +
  "second question goes unanswered when a familar thought comes to mind: " +
  "“Sometimes I wish I would be working from within a whale’s heart. No drama, " +
  "just being at piece.”, she thinks. " +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "Finally going back to answering all the important questions about time " +
  "tracking and invoicing she stumbles across a strangely looking link. " +
  "It takes her to a beautiful website that, after prompting her to input " +
  "several words, presents her with a precise write-up of her morning. " +
  "Reading it with great pleasure all the way to the end makes her understand " +
  "the reasons for all of the weird events of her morning: It’s her birthday!" +
  "<br />" +
  "<br />" +
  "Happy Birthday, Calina!";
